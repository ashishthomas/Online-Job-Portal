# 🧑‍💼 Online Job Portal

An end-to-end job portal web application built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**. This platform facilitates job seekers and employers with modern UI, real-time filtering, and smooth navigation. It mimics the core functionality of real-world job sites like Naukri, Indeed, or LinkedIn Jobs but with a simplified approach for learning and demonstration.
